# Code Restructuring Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **SOLID Principles Applied**:
   - Created separate packages for each responsibility
   - Defined clear interfaces for each service
   - Implemented dependency injection throughout the codebase
   - Made the system extensible without modifying existing code

2. **Package Structure**:
   - `pkg/weather`: Weather service API and models
   - `pkg/deployment`: Deployment safety and operations
   - `pkg/mcp`: MCP protocol handling and server logic

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Improved logging throughout the application
   - Proper error propagation and reporting
   - Consistent error message format

4. **Fixed Hang Issues**:
   - Properly detecting interactive mode vs. piped input
   - Handling server termination correctly in both modes
   - Detailed logging for debugging

5. **Enhanced Usability**:
   - Added a `run.sh` helper script for command-line usage
   - Updated Makefile with convenience targets
   - Improved documentation in ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, and USAGE.md

## Future Improvement Suggestions

1. Add tests for each package and service
2. Implement a mock weather service for testing
3. Add a configuration file for customizing safety parameters
4. Consider implementing a RESTful API as an alternative interface
5. Add caching to reduce API calls for frequently accessed cities
